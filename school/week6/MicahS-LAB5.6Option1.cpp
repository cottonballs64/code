/*
Option 1: Write a program that performs a survey tally on beverages. The
program should prompt for the next person until a sentinel value of â€“1 is
entered to terminate the program. Each person participating in the survey
should choose their favorite beverage from the following list:
1. Coffee 2. Tea 3. Coke 4. Orange Juice
