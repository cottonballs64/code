/*
Write a C++ program that loops through the capital letters of the alphabet, printing the letter and then prints a countdown from 10 to 1, after each letter is printed.   Feel free to collaborate to see if you can get it done.  Sample output:
A
     10
     9
     8
     7
...
     1
B
     10
     9
... etc.
