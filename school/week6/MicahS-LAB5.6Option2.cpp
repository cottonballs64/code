/*
Option 2: Suppose Dave drops a watermelon off a high bridge and lets it fall
until it hits the water. If we neglect air resistance, then the distance d in
meters fallen by the watermelon after t seconds is d = 0.5 * g * t
2
, where the
acceleration of gravity g = 9.8 meters/second2
. Write a program that asks the
user to input the number of seconds that the watermelon falls and the
height h of the bridge above the water. The program should then calculate
the distance fallen for each second from t = 0 until the value of t input by
the user. If the total distance fallen is greater than the height of the bridge,
then the program should tell the user that the distance fallen is not valid.
