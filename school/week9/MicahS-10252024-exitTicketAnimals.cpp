FINISH ME

Attached to this item, you can find the animals.txt file.  Write a C++ program that performs the following:
1.  Read the file and stores the listed strings in either an array or a vector.  These strings are all animal names.
2.  Write a function that prompts the user to enter an animal name and returns that name as a string.
3.  Write a function that performs a linear search on an array or vector of strings searching for a certain string.  The function should count the number of comparisons it performs in order to find the string and print its findings to the console.  Example:  "I found Beetle with a linear search at position 31 after 31 tries."  or "I could not find Bug.  I tried 378 animals."
4.  Write a function that performs the same function, but uses a binary search.
