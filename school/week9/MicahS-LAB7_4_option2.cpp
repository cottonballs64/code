Option 2: Write a program that will input temperatures for consecutive days.
The program will store these values into an array and call a function that
will return the average of the temperatures. It will also call a function that
will return the highest temperature and a function that will return the
lowest temperature. The user will input the number of temperatures to be
read. There will be no more than 50 temperatures. Use typedef to declare
the array type. The average should be displayed to two decimal places.
