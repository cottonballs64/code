Option 3: Write a program that will input letter grades (A, B, C, D, F), the
number of which is input by the user (a maximum of 50 grades). The
grades will be read into an array. A function will be called five times (once
for each letter grade) and will return the total number of grades in that
category. The input to the function will include the array, number of
elements in the array and the letter category (A, B, C, D or F). The program will print the number of grades that are A, B, etc.
