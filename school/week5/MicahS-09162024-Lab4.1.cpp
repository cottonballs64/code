/*
Exercise 1: Run the program several times using a different input each time.
Does the program do what you expect? Is so, explain what it is doing. If
not, locate the error and fix it.


Exercise 2: Modify the program so that the user inputs both values to be
tested for equality. Make sure you have a prompt for each input. Test the
program with pairs of values that are the same and that are different.

Exercise 3: Modify the program so that when the numbers are the same it
prints the following lines:
The values are the same.
Hey thatâ€™s a coincidence!

Exercise 4: Modify the revised Exercise 3 program by replacing the two if
statements with a single if/else statement. Run the program again to test
the results.
