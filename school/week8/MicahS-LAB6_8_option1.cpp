Option 1: Write a program that will convert miles to kilometers and kilometers
to miles. The user will indicate both a number (representing a distance)
and a choice of whether that number is in miles to be converted to kilometers or kilometers to be converted to miles. Each conversion is done
with a value returning function. You may use the following conversions.
1 kilometer = .621 miles
1 mile = 1.61 kilometers
