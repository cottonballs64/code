Option 2: Write a program that will input the number of wins and losses that a
baseball team acquired during a complete season. The wins should be
input in a parameter-less value returning function that returns the wins to
the main function. A similar function should do the same thing for the
losses. A third value returning function calculates the percentage of wins.
It receives the wins and losses as parameters and returns the percentage
(float) to the main program which then prints the result. The percentage
should be printed as a percent to two decimal places.
