Option 3: Write a program that outputs a dentist bill. For members of a dental
plan, the bill consists of the service charge (for the particular procedure
performed) and test fees, input to the program by the user. To nonmembers the charges consist of the above services plus medicine (also
input by the user). The program first asks if the patient is a member of the
dental plan. The program uses two overloaded functions to calculate the
total bill. Both are value returning functions that return the total charge.
