/*
Exercise 1: Develop a design that leads to an algorithm and a program that will
read in a number that represents the number of kilometers traveled. The
output will convert this number to miles. 1 kilometer = 0.621 miles. Call
this program kilotomiles.cpp.
Exercise 2: Compile the program. If you get compile errors, try to fix them and
re-compile until your program is free of syntax errors.
Exercise 3: Run the program. Is your output what you expect from the input
you gave? If not, try to find and correct the logic error and run the program again. Continue this process until you have a program that produces
the correct result.
