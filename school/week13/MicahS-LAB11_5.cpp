/*
Option 1: Re-write Sample Program 11.2 so that it works for an array of
structures. Write the program so that it compares 6 circles. You will need
to come up with a new way of determining which circleâ€™s center is closest
to the origin.
Option 2: Write a program that uses a structure to store the following information for a particular month at the local airport:
Total number of planes that landed
Total number of planes that departed
Greatest number of planes that landed in a given day that month
Least number of planes that landed in a given day that month
The program should have an array of twelve structures to hold travel information
for the entire year. The program should prompt the user to enter data for each
month. Once all data is entered, the program should calculate and output the average monthly number of landing planes, the average monthly number of departing planes, the total number of landing and departing planes for the year, and the
greatest and least number of planes that landed on any one day (and which
month it occurredin).
