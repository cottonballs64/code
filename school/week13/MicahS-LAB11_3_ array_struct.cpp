/*
Exercise 1: Fill in the code as indicated by the comments in bold.
    Done
Exercise 2: In the previous code we have the following:
cout << "Tax Payer # " << (index+1) << ": " << "$ "
<< citizen[index].taxes << endl;
Why do you think we need (index+1) in the first line but index in the
second?
    The index is presumed to start at 0, so adding 1 to it will count up from 1 to 5
