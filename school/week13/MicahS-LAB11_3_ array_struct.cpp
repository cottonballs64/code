// Fill in code to declare a structure called taxPayer that has three
// members: taxRate, income, and taxes â€” each of type float
int main()
{
    // Fill in code to define an array named citizen which holds
    // 5 taxPayers structures
    cout << fixed << showpoint << setprecision(2);
    cout << "Please enter the annual income and tax rate for 5 tax payers: ";
    cout << endl << endl << endl;
    for(int count = 0;count < 5;count++)
    {
        cout << "Enter this year's income for tax payer " << (count + 1);
        cout << ": ";
        // Fill in code to read in the income to the appropriate place
        cout << "Enter the tax rate for tax payer # " << (count + 1);
        cout << ": ";
        // Fill in code to read in the tax rate to the appropriate place
        // Fill in code to compute the taxes for the citizen and store it
        // in the appropriate place
        cout << endl;
        }
        cout << "Taxes due for this year: " << endl << endl;
        // Fill in code for the first line of a loop that will output the
        // tax information
        {
        cout << "Tax Payer # " << (index + 1) << ": " << "$ "
        << citizen[index].taxes << endl;
    }
    return 0;
}

/*
Exercise 1: Fill in the code as indicated by the comments in bold.

Exercise 2: In the previous code we have the following:
cout << "Tax Payer # " << (index+1) << ": " << "$ "
<< citizen[index].taxes << endl;
Why do you think we need (index+1) in the first line but index in the
second?
